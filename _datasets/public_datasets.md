|Name |Purpose|Description|
|:--:|:--:|:--|
|**[Github - Awesome Public Datasets]** |All purpose|This is a list of a topic-centric public data sources in high quality from various domains. Most of the data sets listed below are free.|
|**[Github - Turing Change Point Dataset]** |Change Point Detection| Turing Change Point Dataset is a set of time series specifically collected for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms on real-world data. |
|**[Time Series Classification]** |Time series classification|This site contains data, reference results and links to code for Time Series Classification (TSC), Time Series Clustering (TSCL) and Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER). The classification data form part of the UCR time series archive. Regression data are part of the TSER repository.|
