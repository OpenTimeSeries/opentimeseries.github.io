| Packages | Description | Downloads (pypi) |
|:--:|:--|:--:|
| **[DTW-Python]** | DTW-Python provides the implementation of Dynamic Time Warping-type (DTW) algorithms, which supports arbitrary local (e.g. symmetric, asymmetric, slope-limited) and global (windowing) constraints. | [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/dtw-Python)](https://pepy.tech/project/dtw-Python) |
|    **[Pyts]**    | Pyts is a Python package for time series classification. It aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing preprocessing and utility tools.                                  |       [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/pyts)](https://pepy.tech/project/pyts)       |
