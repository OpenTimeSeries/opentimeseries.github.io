# Time Series Data Engineering

| Packages | Description | Downloads (pypi) |
|:--:|:--|:--:|
|   **[TimeSynth]**   | TimeSynth is an open source library for generating synthetic time series for model testing. The library can generate regular and irregular time series.                                       |    [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/timesynth)](https://pepy.tech/project/timesynth)    |
|   **[Deepecho]**    | DeepEcho is a Synthetic Data Generation Python library for mixed-type, multivariate time series.                                                                                              |     [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/deepecho)](https://pepy.tech/project/deepecho)     |
|   **[Torchtime]**   | Torchtime provides PyTorch data sets for supervised time series classification and prediction problems.                                                                                       |    [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/torchtime)](https://pepy.tech/project/torchtime)    |
|     **[Tsaug]**     | Tsaug is a Python package for time series data augmentation. It offers a set of augmentation methods for time series, as well as a simple API to connect multiple augmenters into a pipeline. |        [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/tsaug)](https://pepy.tech/project/tsaug)        | 
|     **[Tsdb]**      | TSDB provides all-in-one-stop convenience for downloading and loading open-source time-series datasets.                                                                                       |         [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/tsdb)](https://pepy.tech/project/tsdb)         |
| **[Tsdownsample]**  | Tsdownsample is a Python package  for fast time series downsampling.                                                                                                                          | [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/tsdownsample)](https://pepy.tech/project/tsdownsample) |
